LOOP is a logic oriented opaque predicate checker. It is able 
to detect the following opaque predicates in binary code:

1. Invariant opaque predicate
2. Contextual opaque predicate
3. Dynamic opaque predicate

LOOP is developed based on BAP.

BAP: The Binary Analysis Platform. For more information see the
